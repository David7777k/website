<analysis>
The previous AI engineer initiated work on an extensive refactoring and feature addition for a Panda Hookah Lounge application, built with Next.js, Prisma/SQLite, and a FastAPI backend (though  is the primary focus). The initial phase involved understanding a massive set of product requirements covering core screens, engagement features, staff management, promotions, admin/staff panels, statistics, and UX/visuals. The engineer gathered necessary API keys (Google Maps, Spotify), de-prioritizing payment integrations as requested.

The work progressed in two main stages: first, focusing on establishing a robust backend for admin functionalities and integrating external APIs (Spotify, Google Maps, QR, Tips). This phase included significant database schema extensions, creation of numerous API endpoints, and initial admin panel development, successfully passing backend tests. The second stage, following user feedback, shifted towards a deep system analysis, implementing a full account and roles system (email/password alongside Google OAuth), and then a radical design overhaul, which is currently in progress. The engineer has just created an admin account and implemented a new CSS design system, header, and main page, and is now integrating these into the main layout.

The user also explicitly requested to remove all demo data, implement a full account and roles system, drastically change and improve the design to be beautiful and functional, ensure all listed features are present and working perfectly, clean up the codebase (remove unnecessary code, optimize), and then proceed with API integrations. Specifically, for design, they asked for a new account login/button logic, a non-buggy transparent mobile menu, a redesigned main page, beautiful personal cabinet, menu, and settings, fix language switching, and address ugly visuals.

<code_architecture>
The application's primary codebase resides in , overriding an older  and  structure.



**Key Files and Changes:**

*   : This file is critical as it defines the entire database structure. It was significantly expanded to include new models for , , , , , , , , , , , , and  to support the vast new features. Relationships between models were also established.
*   : Created to store sensitive environment variables, including , , , .
*   : The main admin dashboard page. It was initially a basic placeholder and has been significantly modified to fetch and display various administrative data, integrate new UI components for settings and user management, and provide quick actions, including removing older conflicting variables and updating styles.
*   , , , , : Numerous new API routes were created within these directories to handle the backend logic for admin functionalities (settings, stats, users, promos), music integration (search, trending, order), map directions, QR code generation, and direct tips.
*   , , , , , : These  files serve as utility modules encapsulating specific business logic or external API interactions, promoting code reusability and separation of concerns.
*   : This page underwent a complete overhaul to integrate the new Spotify API functionality, allowing users to search for and order music. It was initially using mocked data due to issues with live Spotify API integration during development.
*   : Modified to include  mapping, improving module import resolution within the project ().
*   : Updated to include new dependencies such as , , , , and updated scripts for Prisma commands.
*   , , , , , : A completely new authentication system was built, supporting email/password registration, login, Google OAuth, and middleware for route protection. The NextAuth configuration was updated to include the credentials provider.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was in the process of a radical design overhaul as explicitly requested by the user. This followed a comprehensive deep analysis of the system that highlighted significant UI/UX deficiencies and missing core features.

The work accomplished right before the interruption includes:
1.  **Admin Account Creation:** An admin user ( with password ) was successfully created and assigned the admin role. This is crucial for managing the application and testing administrative functionalities.
2.  **New CSS Design System:** The entire  file was replaced with a new Tailwind CSS-based design system, implementing a dark theme, plump cards, soft shadows, and 2xl rounded corners as specified in the product requirements. This sets the foundation for the new visual identity of the application.
3.  **New Header Component:** A new React component, , was created. This component is designed to provide a modern navigation experience, including a fixed header and an improved mobile menu, addressing specific user complaints about the old header's transparency and buggy mobile behavior.
4.  **Redesigned Main Page:** The  file (the main landing page) was completely rewritten to incorporate the new design principles, making it visually appealing and modern.

The last action recorded was: Теперь обновлю layout, чтобы использовать новый Header:. This indicates that the engineer was in the process of integrating the newly created  component into the main application layout (). The current state of the application has the foundational design elements and an admin account in place, but the new design still needs to be fully integrated into the overall application structure, starting with the layout. The Spotify integration is currently using mock data, which needs to be resolved to use the actual API.
